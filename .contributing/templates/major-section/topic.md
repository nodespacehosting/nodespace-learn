# General Topic

This is a general topic. For example, it might live in a topic and provide additional information. Or it could be a top level page like [the getting started](../../../docs/getting-started.md) page. This section should be used as an introduction to the topic. It should provide a brief overview of the topic and what it covers. It should also provide links to other topics that are related to this topic.

## Secondary heading

This is a secondary heading. You should use secondary headings to break up your content into sections. You can use as many secondary headings as you want. You can also use tertiary headings if you need to break up your content into smaller sections.

## Adding images

If you need to add images, you should add images to the `images` directory in the topic directory. For example, if you're adding images to the `hosting/shared` topic, you should add them to `../docs/hosting/shared/images`. Refer to the images in your content using relative links. For example, if you add an image called `example.png` to the `images` directory, you can refer to it in your content using `![Example](images/example.png)`.
