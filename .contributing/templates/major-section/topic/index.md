# Main Topic

This is the main topic of the major topic. This file should live in `../docs/<topic>` or a subdirectory of `../docs/<topic>` if it is a sub-topic. The file name should be `index.md` if this is the firs page. For example, if the directory is `../docs/hosting/shared/`, the file name should be `index.md` and the `index.md` file should live in `../docs/hosting/shared/`. If you're adding another page to the topic, the file name should match the name of the page. For example, if you're adding a page called `cpanel-email.md`, the file name should be `cpanel-email.md` and the `cpanel-email.md` file should live in `../docs/hosting/shared/`.

## Secondary heading

This is a secondary heading. You should use secondary headings to break up your content into sections. You can use as many secondary headings as you want. You can also use tertiary headings if you need to break up your content into smaller sections.
