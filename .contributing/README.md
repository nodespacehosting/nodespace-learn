# Contributing to NodeSpace Learn

We welcome contributions from the community! If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. We appreciate your help in making this site better for everyone! We have a [contributing guide](../docs/contributing/index.md) that you can read for more information. If your contribution is significant, we'll provide you with free hosting credits as a thank you!

This directory contains some templates that you can use to get started. You can copy these templates to the appropriate location and then edit them to add your content. You can also use these templates as a reference for creating your own content.

## How to get started

1. Fork this repository. You can do this by clicking on the Fork button in the upper right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account and you can make changes to it. You can read more about forking a repository in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo). The contribution guide will help you set up your local environment and get started with making changes and testing them.

2. Create a new branch for your changes. You can name this branch anything you want. You can read more about creating branches in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository). We recommend using a descriptive name for your branch, such as `fix-email-typo` or `add-ssh-key-docs`. If you're going to fix a specific issue, you can use the issue number in the branch name, such as `123-fix-email-typo`. We currently file all issues in the [NodeSpace Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.nodespace.com). We have GitHub issues open, so if there's a Bugzilla issue you want to work on, you should prefix it as `123-fix-email-typo`. If there is a GitHub issue that you want to work on, you should prefix it as `GH-123-fix-email-typo`.

3. Make your changes. You can use the templates in this directory as a starting point. You can also use them as a reference for creating your own content. Please refer to our [style guide](../docs/contributing/style-guide.md) for information on how to format your content. For formatting your content, please refer to the [formatting guide](../docs/contributing/docs-formatting.md).

4. TEST YOUR CHANGES LOCALLY! When you make changes, you should test them locally before submitting a pull request. This will help you catch any errors before you submit your changes. While your changes will be tested by the NodeSpace team before they are merged, it's always a good idea to test your changes locally so you're not surprised if your PR is rejected. If you're having trouble and not sure why your changes aren't working, you can open an issue and we'll help you figure it out. Ideally, you should open a bug in the [NodeSpace Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.nodespace.com) but you can also open a GitHub issue if you prefer.

5. Submit a pull request. When you're ready to submit your changes, you can open a pull request. You can read more about pull requests in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Please refer to our [contribution guide](../docs/contributing/index.md) for more information on how to submit a pull request. We'll review your changes and if everything looks good, we'll merge them into the repository. If there are any issues, we'll let you know and you can make the necessary changes.
