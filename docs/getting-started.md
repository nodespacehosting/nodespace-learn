# Welcome to NodeSpace Hosting

!!! note "This is a getting started guide"
    This is a getting started guide. This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started with NodeSpace and will help you get your first service up and running. The rest of this site contains more detailed information about our services and how to use them. If you have any questions, please feel free to open a support ticket from the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com).

## Ordering a Service

The first step to getting started with NodeSpace is to order a service. You can order a service from the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com). If you don't already have an account, you can create one by clicking on the "Register" button. Once you have an account, you can login and order a service by clicking on the "Order" button. You can also order a service by clicking on the "Services" tab and then clicking on the "Order New Services" button.

## Managing Your Services

Once you have ordered a service, you can manage it from the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com). You can login to the client portal by clicking on the "Login" button. Once you have logged in, you can manage your services by clicking on the "Services" tab. From here, you can view your services, manage your services, and order new services.

## Getting Help

If you need help with your NodeSpace services, please open a support ticket from the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com). You can also reach us by email at [support@nodespace.com](mailto:support@nodespace.com). We have a [knowledge base](https://help.nodespace.com) that contains more detailed information about our services (including this site, which is replacing our knowledge base). You can connect with us on various social media platforms:

You can also connect with other NodeSpace customers on our [Discourse](https://discourse.nodespace.com) server. Our Discourse server is also configured to work as a mailing list if you prefer to use email. This means that most of our categories are mail-enabled. For example, if you're registered, you can send an email to general@discourse.nodespace.com to post in the general category. Most of our categories are configured with ActivityPub so you can use a Mastodon client or webclient to follow along the Discourse activity. For example, [@general@discourse.nodespace.com](https://nodespace.social/@general@discourse.nodespace.com) will show you new topics in the general category.

!!! note
    We do not currently provide support over social media for account security purposes. You can use social media to nudge us if you have an open support ticket that has not been responded to in a timely manner.
