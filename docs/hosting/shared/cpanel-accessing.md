# How to access cPanel

There are several ways that you can access cPanel. The most common method is to go to `/cpanel` from your domain (for example, https://example.com/cpanel) or by appending port 2086 (for example https://example.com:2083) 

You can alternatively access cPanel through single sign on in the Client Portal or by using the same methods described above but with the server's hostname. You can find your server's hostname from the Client Portal.

!!! note
    cPanel currently does not have granular access controls. If you grant someone access to your cPanel account, they can access everything within cPanel.
