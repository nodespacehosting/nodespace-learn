# Frequently Asked Questions - Shared Hosting

## Is there a minimum contract period?

No, there is no minimum contract period. You can cancel your service at any time. We offer billing on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual basis. You can choose the billing cycle that works best for you. If you choose annual billing, you will receive a free domain registration. You can also change from monthly billing to annual billing at any time to receive a free domain registration. If you sign up for annual billing and want to move to monthly billing, your account will be credited for the remaining months of your annual billing cycle.
