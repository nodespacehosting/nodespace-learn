# Billing Extension

We understand that things happen and for some reason or another you are unable to make an on-time payment. We are happy to work with you to ensure that your services remain online and accessible. If you are unable to make a payment on time, please contact our billing team as soon as possible. You can contact our billing team by opening a support ticket from the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com). You can also reach us by email at [billing@nodespace.com](mailto:billing@nodespace.com). 

The sooner you contact us, the easier it is for us to ensure that your services are not suspended or terminated. We can also waive late fees if you contact us before your payment is due. If you contact us after your payment is due, we may not be able to waive late fees or prevent your services from being suspended or terminated.
