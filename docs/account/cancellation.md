# Account Cancellation

You can cancel your account at any time by logging into the My NodeSpace customer portal and clicking on the "Request Cancellation" link under the "Actions" menu for the service you want to cancel. You can also contact our billing team by opening a support ticket from the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com). For security reasons, we cannot accept cancellation requests by email. They must be submitted through the NodeSpace Client Portal.

!!! warning
    IMPORTANT: If your product or service does not have a request cancellation button, you must open a billing ticket to request cancellation. Cancellation tickets must be received at least 24 hours prior to service due date in order to cancel.

You will be prompted with a form to say why you're cancelling. While it is optional, please include a reason for your cancellation to better help us improve our services.

!!! warning "Cancel PayPal Subscription Payments"
    Please cancel any PayPal subscriptions you may have after cancelling your service with us. If you do not cancel your subscription, PayPal will continue to bill you! **We do not offer refunds for PayPal subscriptions that are not cancelled.**

## Cancellation Types

We offer two types of cancellations: immediate cancellation and end of billing period cancellation. If you choose immediate cancellation, your service will be terminated immediately and you will not be billed again. If you choose end of billing period cancellation, your service will remain active until the end of your current billing period and you will not be billed again. If you choose end of billing period cancellation, you will still be able to access your service until the end of your current billing period.

!!! note
    If you choose immediate cancellation, your service will be terminated **within the next 24 hours**. We do not offer refunds for unused time if you choose immediate cancellation. When your service is terminated, all of your data will be deleted and cannot be recovered. If you want to keep your data, you should download it before you cancel your service.

!!! warning 
    If you have changed your mind about cancelling your service, you need to contact our billing team as soon as possible. If you do not contact our billing team before your service is terminated, we will not be able to recover your data.
