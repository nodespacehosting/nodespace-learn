# Invoicing

This article explains how our invoicing works. Invoicing can be confusing, so we've tried to make it as simple as possible. If you have any questions about our invoicing, please contact our billing team. Invoicing can also be specific to your account, so this article may not cover everything about your account.

## 1. Invoices

We send invoices for all services 7 days before the due date. If you have automatic payments enabled, we will automatically charge your payment method for the invoice. If you do not have automatic payments enabled, you will need to pay the invoice manually. We offer a 3 day grace period for all invoices. If you do not pay an invoice within 3 days of the due date, your service will be suspended. You will need to pay the invoice to unsuspend your service. If you do not pay the invoice within 30 days of the due date, your service will be terminated. Not all services are able to be restored if terminated.

If your service is billed quarterly, then we will send an invoice 14 days before the due date. All other billing cycles will receive an invoice 30 days before the due date.

Invoices are sent out via email to the email address on file. Additional email addresses can be added to receive invoices by adding a contact to your account. You can add a contact by logging into the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com) and clicking on the "Contacts/Sub-Accounts" tab. You can add a contact by clicking on the "Add Contact" button. You can add an email address to receive invoices by clicking on the "Add Email" button next to the contact you want to add an email address to.

## 2. Invoice Contents

Invoices contain information about your service. Each service is typically billed separately, so you may receive multiple invoices for your account. Invoices will contain basic details about your service, such as the service name, the billing cycle, the due date, and the amount due. Invoices will also contain a breakdown of the charges for the invoice. If you have automatic payments enabled, the invoice will contain a note that your payment method will be charged automatically.

## 3. Metric Billing

Some services utilize metric billing and metric billing always lags behind the current date. For example, if you have a service that is billed monthly, then the invoice will be for the previous month. These items will be added to your next invoice automatically. Even if you don't have a balance due, these items are included on your invoice.

### 3.1 Service cancellation/termination

If a service is cancelled or terminated and there is active metric billing, then the metric billing will be added to the final invoice. The final invoice will be generated at cancellation/termination and must be paid immediately. If the final invoice is not paid, we will refer the invoice to collections and report your details to MaxMind and FraudRecord.
