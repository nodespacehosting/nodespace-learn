## Money Back Guarantees

We offer serveral money back guarantees for several of our main services:

- Shared Hosting: 45 day money back guarantee
- VPS Hosting: 7 day money back guarantee
- Dedicated Servers: 3 day money back guarantee

If you are not satisfied with your service, you can request a refund within the money back guarantee period. If you request a refund within the money back guarantee period, we will refund your payment in full. If you request a refund after the money back guarantee period, we will not refund your payment. This is a **no questions asked money back guarantee**. You do not need to provide a reason for your refund request.

!!! note "PayPal Refunds"
    PayPal in the past used to refund us the transaction fees when we refunded payments. They silently changed their policy a few years ago where they "double dip" on transaction fees - that is when you initially pay us, we pay PayPal a fee. If we refund you, PayPal then charges us *another* fee. Therefore, we will issue a refund minus the two fees.

!!! example "PayPal Refund Example"
    If you pay us $100 and we refund you $100, we will only refund you $97.30. This is because PayPal charges us $2.70 to refund you. We do not have any control over this and we cannot refund you the full amount. We apologize for this inconvenience. If you don't like this policy, we suggest you don't use PayPal or complain to them that their fee policy is unfair.

!!! warning "Cryptocurrency Payments"
    **We do not offer refunds for cryptocurrency payments regardless of if the service has a money back guarantee.**
