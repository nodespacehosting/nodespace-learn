# Account Transfers

Websites and services can be traded or sold like commodoties and we believe that as you're paying for the service, you should be albe to do with it as you please. However, we do have several policies and procedures in place that need to be followed. We try to make this process as easy as possible to follow and without any roadblocks. 

!!! note
    Please keep in mind that this process is manual for security reasons. We take account security very seriously and therefore we do not allow any automated account transfers. We've found computers tend to make silly mistakes and we want to ensure that your account is transferred correctly and securely.

## Account Transfer Process

!!! note
    This is a multi-stage process. These stages can run concurrently, but they must be completed in order to tranfer the requested services.

### Stage 1: Bring the account up to date

The first step in the process is to bring the account up to date. This means that any outstanding invoices must be paid in full. If you have any questions about your invoices, please contact our billing team. If an invoice was just issued for the service, that invoice must be paid prior to the transfer. **There must be a zero balance on any of the services requested to be transferred.**

### Stage 2: New owner creates an account

The person or organization that will be taking over the service must create an account with us if they don't already have one. This can be done by going to the [My NodeSpace Portal](https://my.nodespace.com) and clicking on the "Register" button. Once the account is created, please contact our billing team to let us know that you've created an account and that you're ready to proceed with the transfer.

### Stage 3: Request transfer

You will now need to open up a ticket with our Billing team in the [My NodeSpace Portal](https://my.nodespace.com). You can do this by clicking on the "Support" tab and then clicking on the "Open Ticket" button. In the ticket, please include the following information:

- The service you want to transfer (provide IP address and/or hostname)
- The name and email address of the receiving party.

Once we have this information, we will perform a manual fraud check on the receiving party.

!!! warning
    We take fraud very seriously. If we find that the receiving party has a history of fraud, we will not allow the transfer to proceed. If we find that the receiving party has a history of abuse (such as spamming or other malicious activities) or has violated our policies in the past, we will not allow the transfer to proceed.

### Stage 4: Confirmation from receiving party

The receiving party needs to confirm they are taking ownership of the services you are transferring. Once they confirm, we will start the transfer. If the receiving party does not confirm, we will not proceed with the transfer. Please make sure they are aware of this and respond to our emails or keep an eye in the ticket for any updates.

### Stage 5: Transfer

Our team will move your services to the receiving party. At that point, they will assume full responsibility and ownership. You will no longer have any access, responsibility, or privilege to the services. If your service has metric billing that is delayed (for example, bandwidth overages or cPanel accounts), the receiving party will be responsible for those charges on the future invoice. If you know those charges exist, you should make them aware. 

!!! warning
    Once services are transferred, **you will have no further access or responsibility to the services**. Please make sure you have a backup of any data you need prior to the transfer. We will not be able to provide you with any data after the transfer is complete. Further, accessing the services after the transfer is complete may be considered hacking and we will take appropriate action, including legal action, if necessary, if you do not have authorization from the new account owner.
