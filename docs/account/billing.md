# Billing

Information about our invoicing is available in our [Invoicing](invoicing.md) article.

## 1. Payment Methods

We accept all major credit cards and PayPal. If you're on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac using Safari, you can also pay with Apple Pay. Payment by check is also available for business accounts based in the United States upon request. We also accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through BitPay.

!!! note
    We bill in US Dollars (USD). If you are paying with a credit card or PayPal, your payment will be converted to USD by your bank or PayPal. If you are paying with Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, your payment will be converted to USD by BitPay.

### 1.1. Changing Your Payment Method

You can change your payment method at any time by logging into the [NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com) and clicking on the "Billing" tab. You can add a new payment method by clicking on the "Add Payment Method" button. You can remove a payment method by clicking on the "Remove" button next to the payment method you want to remove.

## 2. Automatic Payments

You can enable automatic payments for your account by adding a credit card or PayPal account to your account when ordering. If you do not enable automatic payments, you will need to pay each invoice manually.

### 2.1. Automatic Payments with PayPal

If you add a PayPal account to your account, we will automatically charge your PayPal account through a subscription for each invoice. If you do not have enough funds in your PayPal account to pay the invoice, PayPal will charge your backup payment method. If you do not have a backup payment method, PayPal will not be able to process the payment and your service will be suspended. You will need to pay the invoice manually to unsuspend your service.

!!! note
    If you have a PayPal subscription set up for your account, you will not be able to pay invoices manually. You will need to cancel your PayPal subscription to pay invoices manually. If you pay an invoice manually while you have a PayPal subscription set up, the overpayment will automatically be credited to your account. Please pause your PayPal Subscription if you want to use the credit on your account.

### 2.2. Automatic Payments with Credit Card

If you add a credit card to your account, you will not automatically enroll in automatic payments. You will need to contact our billing team to enable automatic payments for your account. If you have automatic payments enabled for your account, we will automatically charge your credit card for each invoice. If your credit card is declined, you will need to make a manual payment.

## 3. Grace Period

We offer a 3 day grace period for all invoices. If you do not pay an invoice within 3 days of the due date, your service will be suspended. You will need to pay the invoice to unsuspend your service. If you do not pay the invoice within 30 days of the due date, your service will be terminated. Not all services are able to be restored if terminated.

## 4. Refunds

We do not offer refunds for any services, but we do offer a money back guarantee for most services[^1]. If you are not satisfied with your service, you can request a refund within 45 days of the date of signing up, within 3 days for dedicated servers. If you request a refund within 45 days of the date of purchase (3 for dedicated servers), we will refund your payment in full[^2]. If you request a refund after 45 days of the date of signing up (3 days for dedicated servers), we will not refund your payment.

!!! warning "Chargebacks & Disputes"
    If you file a chargeback or dispute with your bank or PayPal, your service will be suspended (if active) and you will be charged a $25 fee. You will not be eligible for a refund. **We will report you to FraudRecord and MaxMind for fraud and theft of service.** If you have a question about your bill or service, please contact our billing team and attempt to resolve the issue before filing a chargeback or dispute.
