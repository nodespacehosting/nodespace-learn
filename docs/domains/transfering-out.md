# Transferring a Domain Out

!!! warning "Newly registered domains have a 60-day lock"
    If you just registered a domain with us and want to transfer it out to another registrar, **you must wait 60 days from the date of registration** before you can transfer your domain name to another registrar. This is an ICANN rule, not ours! 

NodeSpace does not require you to keep your domain name(s) registered with us. You are free to transfer your domain name(s) to another registrar at any time. This guide will walk you through the process of transferring your domain name(s) to another registrar.

!!! warning "ICANN has rules that may limit your transfer"
    Please be advised that [ICANN](https://www.icann.org) has rules that may limit your ability to transfer your domain name(s) to another registrar. Please review the [ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en) for more information.

!!! success "Your domain rights"
    NodeSpace respects the rules put in place by ICANN and additionally, we guarantee all of our clients the following rights when registering a domain name with us:

    - You have the right to transfer your domain name to another registrar after 60 days from the date of registration.
    - You have the right to transfer your domain name to another registrar after 60 days from the date of a previous transfer.
    - You have the right to use your domain name with any service provider you choose.
    - You have the right to know the full price you will pay for your domain name registration.
    - You have the right to know the full price you will pay for any renewals of your domain name.
    - You have the right to ownership of your domain name.

    Please keep in mind some of our service offerings may be bundled with domains. For example, if you purchase a hosting package that includes free domain name renewal, if you transfer your domain name to another registrar, you will lose the free domain name renewal and will be responsible for renewing your domain name with the new registrar.

## How to transfer your domain name

First, you need to unlock your domain. By default, your domain is locked to prevent unauthorized access and updates. To unlock your domain, login to your [My NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com) and navigate to the "Domains" section. Click on the domain name you wish to transfer and then click on the "Unlock Domain" button.

To transfer your domain name to another registrar, you will need to obtain an [EPP code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Provisioning_Protocol) from us. This code is used to verify your identity and authorize the transfer of your domain name. To obtain your EPP code, login to your [My NodeSpace Client Portal](https://my.nodespace.com) and navigate to the "Domains" section. Click on the domain name you wish to transfer and then click on the "Get EPP Code" button. You will be presented with your EPP code.

!!! warning "Your EPP code is sensitive"
    Please keep your EPP code safe and secure. If someone else obtains your EPP code, they can transfer your domain name without your permission.

Once you have your EPP code, go to your new registrar and follow their transfer process. You will need to provide them the EPP code we provided you. Once the transfer process is complete, your domain name will be transferred to your new registrar.

At this point, **closely follow the directions of your new registrar**. You may need to check the registrant email for your domain name and approve the transfer. If you do not approve the transfer, your domain name will not be transferred. Sometimes you can even expedite the transfer process by approving the transfer immediately. This option is not always available.

!!! note "Transferring a domain name does not transfer any other services"
    Transferring a domain name does not transfer any other services you may have with NodeSpace. For example, if you have a hosting package with us, you will need to cancel that service separately. **You do not need to buy hosting or move your website to your new registrar for your domain name to work with services hosted with us.**

It can take up to 7 days for a transfer to go through. Once the transfer is complete, your domain name will be managed by your new registrar. You will need to contact them for any changes to your domain name.

!!! note "You can transfer your domain name back to NodeSpace"
    If you wish to transfer your domain name back to NodeSpace, you can do so at any time after 60 days from transferring your domain. Please follow the same process outlined above. 

!!! warning "60-Day Lock"
    Please note that ICANN requires a 60-day lock on domain names after they are registered or transferred. This means you cannot transfer your domain name to another registrar until 60 days after you register or transfer your domain name. This is a requirement of ICANN and cannot be waived.
