# Transfer Domain to NodeSpace

You can transfer your domain name to NodeSpace from another registrar. This guide will help you transfer your domain name to NodeSpace from another registrar.

When you transfer a domain to NodeSpace, we will charge you a discounted rate for the domain name registration. This discounted rate will renew at the regular rate for the domain name registration. For example, if you transfer a `.com` domain name to NodeSpace, we will charge you $11.00 for the first year. The domain name will renew at $12.00 per year after the first year.

## Before you begin

Before you can start the process, you need to perform the following steps and gather the required information before you can proceed.

### 0. Verify your domain is eligible for transfer and check contacts

Before you can transfer your domain name to NodeSpace, you need to make sure your domain name is eligible for transfer. Please see the [ICANN Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en) for more information. If you have just registered or renewed your domain name or transferred to your current registrar, **your domain will be locked for 60 days**. You will need to wait 60 days before you can transfer your domain name to NodeSpace. This is an ICANN rule, not ours! 

You will also need to make sure your domain name is not expired. If your domain name is expired, you will need to renew it with your current registrar before you can transfer it to NodeSpace.

Check to make sure your domain name contact information is up to date, especially the "registrant email" address. This email will receive important notifications, including links to approve the transfer. If your domain name contact information is not up to date, you will need to update it with your current registrar before you can transfer it to NodeSpace. 

!!! warning "Updating domain contact information can trigger a 60 day lock period"
    Updating your domain name contact information, including the registrant email, can trigger a 60 day lock period. ICANN does not require all registrars to follow this specific timelock rule, but be advised that it may prevent you from transferring your domain for 60 days.

Make sure your domain is not maxed out on the number of years it can be registered. For example, if your domain name is a `.com` domain, it can only be registered for a maximum of 10 years. If your domain name is maxed out, you will need to wait until at least 1 year falls off before you can transfer it to NodeSpace.

!!! example
    If your domain name is a `.com` domain, it can only be registered for a maximum of 10 years. If your domain name is registered for 10 years, you will need to wait until at least 1 year falls off before you can transfer it to NodeSpace.
    
    For example, you register `example.com` on July 1, 2023 for 10 years. This means your domain would not expire until July 1, 2033. If you want to transfer your domain to NodeSpace, the soonest possible date you could transfer is July 1, 2024 since your domain will have only 9 years left on the registration. This is because we will automatically add 1 year to your domain. Once you transfer, your new expiration date will be July 1, 2034.

### 1. Unlock your domain name

You will need to unlock your domain name with your current registrar. This is usually done through your registrar's control panel. If you are unsure how to unlock your domain name, please contact your current registrar for assistance.

### 2. Get your EPP code

You will need to get your EPP code from your current registrar. This is usually done through your registrar's control panel. If you are unsure how to get your EPP code, please contact your current registrar for assistance.

### 3. Begin the transfer process

At this point, you should have your EPP code and your domain name should be unlocked. You can now begin the transfer process. Order a domain name transfer from our website. You will need to provide your EPP code during the order process. Once you have completed the order process, you will receive an email with a link to approve the transfer. You will need to click the link in the email to approve the transfer. If you do not approve the transfer within 5 days, the transfer will fail and you will need to start the process over. 

!!! warning "Transfer fees are non-refundable"
    If your transfer is denied for any reason, the transfer fee will not be refunded.
