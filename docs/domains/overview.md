## Domain Name Rights 

NodeSpace firmly believes that you have rights to your domain name that you pay for and register with us. Please review the following information to learn more about your rights.

### You have the right to transfer your domain to another registrar

You have the right to transfer your domain name to another registrar after 60 days from the date of registration. Whether or not you can transfer your domain name to another registrar depends on the following factors:

- The domain name is not in a 60-day transfer lock period due to a previous transfer. **This is an ICANN rule, not ours!**
- The domain name is not in a 60-day transfer lock period due to a recent registration. **This is an ICANN rule, not ours!**
- The domain name is not in a 60-day transfer lock period due to a recent change to the registrant contact information. **This is an ICANN rule, not ours!**

!!! warning "60 Day Lock Period"
    ICANN mandates a 60-day lock period for all domain names that are registered, transferred, or have their registrant contact information changed. This is an ICANN rule, not ours! It's designed to prevent domain name theft and abuse. If you are planning on transferring your domain name to another registrar, please keep this in mind.

### You have the right to transfer your domain after a previous transfer

You have the right to transfer your domain name to another registrar after 60 days from the date of a previous transfer. Whether or not you can transfer your domain name to another registrar depends on the factors listed in the previous section. Sometimes we're just not the right service provider for you and that's okay. We'll be sad to see you go, but we'll be happy to help you transfer your domain name to another registrar.

### You have the right to use your domain name with any service provider you choose

You have the right to use your domain name with any service provider you choose. We don't believe in locking you into our services. If you want to use your domain name with another service provider, you have the right to do so. We'll help you update your domain name settings to point to the service provider.

### You have the right to know the full price you will pay for your domain name registration

You have the right to know the full price you will pay for your domain name registration. We don't believe in hiding the true cost of your domain name registration. We'll always show you the full price you will pay for your domain name registration. We'll never hide the true cost of your domain name registration in the fine print. That means any promotional pricing will be clearly marked as such and the full price you will pay for your domain name registration will be clearly marked as well. We'll also include all fees in the price you see. That means you'll never be surprised by additional fees when you check out.

### You have the right to know the full price you will pay for any renewals of your domain name

Just like when registering a new domain, you have the right to know the full price you will pay for any renewals of your domain name. Occasionally, we may run promotional pricing on new registrations but this pricing will not apply to a future renewal. We will always show you the full price, including any fees, you will pay for any renewals of your domain name.

!!! note "Domain pricing can change"
    Domain pricing as of recent times has become very volatile. We do our best to keep our pricing as low as possible, but sometimes we have to adjust our pricing to keep up with the market. We'll always notify you of any price changes before they take effect.

### You have the right to ownership of your domain name

You have the right to ownership of your domain name. We don't believe in holding your domain name hostage. If you want to transfer your domain name to another registrar, we'll help you do so. We'll never hold your domain name hostage or prevent you from transferring your domain name to another registrar.

!!! note "Domain name ownership"
    Please keep in mind some of our service offerings may be bundled with domains. For example, if you purchase a hosting package that includes free domain name renewal, if you transfer your domain name to another registrar, you will lose the free domain name renewal and will be responsible for renewing your domain name with the new registrar.
