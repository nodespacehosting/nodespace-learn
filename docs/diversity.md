## Erradicating Problematic Language

While we strive to make our documentation as inclusive as possible, some projects are still using language that is not inclusive and may be deemed offensive by some. We use the langage that the projects use in order to make it easier for our customers to find the information they need. We are working with the projects to make their documentation more inclusive and we will update our documentation as soon as the projects update their documentation. If you find any language in our documentation that you feel is not inclusive, please let us know by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.

Some examples of problematic language that we are working to eradicate from our documentation and upstream projects: 

- Master/slave
- Whitelist/blacklist
- Whitelisted/blacklisted

Alternatives to the above terms:

- Primary/replica
- Main/secondary
- Allowlist/denylist
- Allowlisted/denylisted

Some of this lanaguage may still exist because of the use of software that doesn't update as frequently or may not be actively maintained. We are working with the projects to make their documentation more inclusive and we will update our documentation as soon as the projects update their documentation.
