## Email Hosting

NodeSpace offers two main types of email hosting - first, the email hosting that comes with [shared hosting](../hosting/shared/cpanel-email.md) and professional email hosting. Professional email hosting is available as an add-on to any service. Professional email hosting offers redundant email servers, advanced spam filtering, and more. You can also run your own email server on a [VPS](../servers/vps/index.md) or [dedicated server](../servers/dedicated/overview.md).
