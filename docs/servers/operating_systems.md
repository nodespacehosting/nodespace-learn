# Operating Systems

We offer a variety of Linux and UNIX-based operating systems to choose from. Windows Server is available on a BYOL (Bring Your Own License)/trial basis. 

!!! note
    Not all operating systems are available for automated installation. We are working to add more operating systems to our automated installation system. If you need an operating system that is not available for automated installation, manual installation is available via IPMI.

??? note "VPS Note"
    Not all operating systems are available for virtual servers. If you need an operating system that is not available for virtual servers, please contact our sales team and we will be happy to assist you. Small VPS instances are limited to operating systems that are available for automated installation. If you need an operating system that is not available for automated installation, our support team can install for you or load the ISO for you to install yourself.

??? danger "Older Operating Systems"
    We limit the availability of older operating systems to ensure that our customers are using operating systems that are supported by the vendor. If you need an older operating system, please contact our support team and we will be happy to assist you. We will do our best to accommodate your request, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to provide the operating system you need. We strongly recommend that you use a supported operating system. Running an unsupported operating system can put your server at risk.
