# Public Networking

## Overview

NodeSpace offers public networking on all of our dedicated and virtual servers. Public networking allows you to create a private network between your servers. This private network is isolated from the public internet and is only accessible from your servers. This allows you to create a secure network between your servers that is not accessible from the public internet.

## Public IP Addresses

NodeSpace offers public IP addresses on all of our dedicated and virtual servers. You can purchase additional IP addresses from the [NodeSpace Client Area](https://my.nodespace.net/cart.php?gid=addons). You can also request additional IP addresses by opening a support ticket. Additional IP addresses are available with justification. IP Address pricing is listed in our client area.
