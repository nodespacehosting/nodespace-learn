# Public Networking

!!! note
    This is a work in progress.

## Overview

NodeSpace offers public networking on all of our dedicated and virtual servers. Public networking allows you to create a private network between your servers. This private network is isolated from the public internet and is only accessible from your servers. This allows you to create a secure network between your servers that is not accessible from the public internet.
