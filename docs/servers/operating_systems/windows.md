Windows Server is a group of operating systems designed by Microsoft that supports enterprise-level management, data storage, applications, and communications. Previous versions of Windows Server have focused on stability, security, networking, and various improvements to the file system. Other improvements also have included improvements to deployment technologies, as well as increased hardware support.

!!! note "Windows Server is a paid operating system"
    Windows Server is a paid operating system. You can purchase a license from Microsoft or a Microsoft reseller. NodeSpace currently **does not** offer Windows Server licenses.

!!! warning "Bring Your Own License"
    If you have a Windows Server license, you can use it on your NodeSpace server. You will need to provide your own license key. This can be provided during the order process or by opening a support ticket. Otherwise, we will install a trial version of Windows Server which is good for 180 days.
