# Managaging your VPS

Your VPS can be managed from our [server management platform](management/vps.md). You can learn more about our server management platform [here](management/index.md).

The server management platform allows you to manage your VPS, including reinstalling your operating system, rebooting your VPS, and viewing your VPS's console.
