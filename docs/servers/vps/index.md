# Virtual Private Servers

NodeSpace offers a number of virtual private server (VPS) options. These VPSs are hosted on our high-performance virtualization platform and are available in a number of configurations. We offer primarily Linux-based VPSs, but we also offer Windows-based VPSs upon request. Our VPSs are hosted on Proxmox VE, a high-performance virtualization platform based on KVM and LXC. All of our VPSs are currently based on KVM virtualization.
